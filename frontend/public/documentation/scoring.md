Once you are happy with your strategy and tested it you can submit it to be 
ranked. Bots are ranked by playing multiple games against other bots with 
similar scores. After each games the score of the winning bot is increased and 
the losing bots decreased. However, at any time your bot may play some rounds 
even if it already has a score and therefore the score may change in the future.

The exact scoring formula is a secret and may be subject to change in the 
future.
